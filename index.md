## Motivation  
My wife is blind and suffers greatly from carpal and cubital tunnel from using a white cane for over 40 years. I intend to develop or facilitate the development of a wearable device that can substantially reduce her need to use the back and forth motion of her white cane.   

## Initial Impressions  
I was shocked to see how many research projects and products there were out there that I have never heard of. The writing on the wall for these efforts is that they have not been widely adopted and so they are not widely known. Is the task too hard? Is there some fundamental shift in thinking about how the products should work? I am determined to find out and have compiled the list of projects and products along with my impressions of each.
